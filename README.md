I'm trying to **learn**, **work** and **think** in an open-source way.

## Learn publicly in an open-source way!

- discuss with all my friends publicly at [discussions](https://github.com/Xuanwo/Xuanwo/discussions).
- public all my notes at [Xuanwo's Note](https://note.xuanwo.io)

## Work publicly and report to the community!

- I get paid for my work in open source projects. (For now, I'm backed by [@datafuselabs](https://github.com/datafuselabs))
- I publicly track all my works at [Xuanwo's Work](https://work.xuanwo.io)

## Think publicly and export to blog posts!

- I will write at [Xuanwo's Blog](https://xuanwo.io) if there are any thought I think is meaningful to report.

I think it's a reproducible way for learning, working and thinking. Anyone with a similar background to mine can start learning incrementally with this repo. Also, It will be very interesting to see how this project will develop in the end. Whether the end result is good or bad, I believe it will be an interesting journey.
  
**Let's rock!**
